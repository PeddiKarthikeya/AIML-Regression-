# Overview

This repository demonstrates Simple Linear Regression using R. Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and an independent variable (X) using a straight line.

# Features
Creates a dataset with X and Y values.
Fits a Simple Linear Regression model.
Displays the model summary.
Predicts Y values based on the regression model.
Visualizes the regression line using ggplot2.

# Installation

->Ensure you have R installed along with the ggplot2 package:
install.packages("ggplot2")

Output:

Printed Summary: Displays model coefficients and statistical details.

Predicted Values: Adds predicted Y values to the dataset.

Plot: Generates a scatter plot with a fitted regression line.
